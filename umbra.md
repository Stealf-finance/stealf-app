# Umbra integration in Stealf

This document covers the three Colosseum requirements: Problem & target users, How Stealf uses the Umbra SDK, and Build/test/use. For the higher-level project pitch, see [`README.md`](README.md).

## 1. Problem, target users, use cases

### Problem

On-chain balances on Solana are public by default. In 2020, this was livable. Blockchain analytics was expensive, manual, and reserved for high-stakes investigations. The average user was effectively anonymous through obscurity.

In 2026, that calculus is gone.

AI agents scrape, index, and correlate every transaction at zero marginal cost. They don't distinguish between sensitive and trivial. They ingest everything. A wallet address, an ENS record, a Twitter handle, a leaked KYC dataset: five seconds and an LLM links them all. Your salary, your trading P&L, your medical payments, your counterparties: all public, all permanent, all instantly searchable.

Privacy on Solana isn't optional anymore. It's table stakes for any product that handles real money.

Users moving cash on Solana need a privacy layer that doesn't force them to give up self-custody and doesn't route through a centralized mixer. That's where Umbra comes in.

### Target users

Crypto-native users whose entire financial life runs on-chain. Traders who don't want every position broadcast on Arkham. Founders and builders paid in stablecoins who need to receive a salary, spend it, and save it without exposing their entire treasury. Remote workers and freelancers paid in USDC who treat their Solana wallet as their primary bank account.

These users already self-custody. They already use their wallet daily. What they don't have is a way to plug it into real-world banking (card payments, bank transfers, fiat off-ramp) without making their on-chain life public to anyone with their address.

### Use cases

1. **Private payroll → savings.** Receive salary into the Bank wallet (USDC on a public Solana account) → Shield into the Stealth wallet's encrypted balance → savings sit off-chain-readable. Block explorers no longer see the running balance.

2. **Private off-ramp.** Unshield from the encrypted balance back to the Bank wallet's public balance → off-ramp to fiat via card or bank transfer. The on-chain trail breaks at the encrypted balance: the cash-out is uncorrelated with the original inflow.

3. **P2P private send between Stealf users.** Stealth wallet A holds encrypted USDC → sends to Stealth wallet B's encrypted balance via an Umbra UTXO transfer. Amount and recipient identity are not on-chain visible. The Umbra relayer pays the fee, so neither party needs SOL on the involved address.

## 2. How Stealf uses the Umbra SDK

### Two wallets, two clients, two signers

Stealf provisions two distinct wallets per user:

- **Bank wallet** — Solana account custodied by Turnkey. The private key lives inside Turnkey's TEE; the client never sees it. All bank-wallet Solana transactions are signed remotely via Turnkey's signing API.
- **Stealth wallet** — local ED25519 keypair. Private key bytes stored in iOS Keychain via `expo-secure-store` and cached at runtime in `walletKeyCache` (15-minute TTL).

`UmbraClient` instances are built per wallet via Umbra's `getUmbraClient` factory. Stealf maintains two:

- `getStealthClient()` (`src/services/umbra/client.ts:94-103`, builder at `:36-86`) — primary client for the encrypted balance flows. Signer is the local ED25519 stealth key, wrapped via `createSignerFromPrivateKeyBytes` from `@umbra-privacy/sdk`.
- `getBankClient()` (`src/services/umbra/client.ts:127-161`) — used when an Umbra operation must be signed by the bank wallet (typical case: deposit from the bank's public USDC balance into a receiver-claimable UTXO destined for a stealth recipient). Signer is the Turnkey custodial signer.

The bank-wallet signer adapter is a custom bridge: `createTurnkeyUmbraSigner` (`src/services/umbra/turnkeySigner.ts:1-40`) implements Umbra's `IUmbraSigner` interface on top of Turnkey's `signTransaction` and `signMessage` APIs. The adapter serialises the SignableTransaction to wire format, sends the bytes to Turnkey for remote signing, and decodes the response back into a SignedTransaction.

### Primitives consumed from `@umbra-privacy/sdk`

- **Registration.** `getUserRegistrationFunction` paired with a custom prover from `@umbra-privacy/rn-zk-prover` (see `src/features/stealth/lib/registration.ts:1-49`). Both wallets get registered on Umbra's `EncryptedUserAccount` PDA on first use.
- **Deposit (public → encrypted).** `getPublicBalanceToEncryptedBalanceDirectDepositorFunction` — `src/services/umbra/operations/deposit.ts`.
- **Withdraw (encrypted → public).** `getEncryptedBalanceToPublicBalanceDirectWithdrawerFunction` — `src/services/umbra/operations/withdraw.ts`.
- **Create UTXO (4 variants).** `getEncryptedBalanceToReceiverClaimableUtxoCreatorFunction`, `getEncryptedBalanceToSelfClaimableUtxoCreatorFunction`, `getPublicBalanceToReceiverClaimableUtxoCreatorFunction`, `getPublicBalanceToSelfClaimableUtxoCreatorFunction` — used in `src/services/umbra/operations/{transfer,sendEncrypted,claim}.ts`.
- **Claim.** `getReceiverClaimableUtxoToEncryptedBalanceClaimerFunction` + `getSelfClaimableUtxoToPublicBalanceClaimerFunction` — `src/services/umbra/operations/claim.ts`.
- **Scan pending UTXOs.** `getClaimableUtxoScannerFunction` — `src/services/umbra/queries/claims.ts`.
- **Relayer.** `getUmbraRelayer` exposed by `getRelayer()` — `src/services/umbra/client.ts:168-170`. Used for fee-free claims so recipients don't need SOL on their stealth wallet.

### ZK provers (`@umbra-privacy/rn-zk-prover`)

Mopro-bundled native xcframework distributed via npm (no Rust toolchain required at build time). The provers are wired in `src/features/stealth/zk/provers/`:

- `register.ts` — user registration prover
- `createUtxos.ts` — UTXO creators (covers create-utxo paths from both encrypted-balance and public-balance sources, with both receiver-unlocker and ephemeral-unlocker variants)
- `claimsUtxos.ts` — claim provers (receiver and ephemeral)
- `prover.ts` — shared prover lifecycle (memoization, asset loading)

zkey assets:

- `assets/zk/createdepositwithpublicamount.zkey` (~4.0 MB) — shipped in-bundle for the public-balance → encrypted-balance hot path.
- Other circuits' zkeys are lazy-fetched from a CDN at first use, managed by `src/features/stealth/zk/services/zkAssetService.ts`.

### User-facing surfaces

UI labels follow the contract pinned in [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md):

- **Shield** — Bank wallet public balance → Stealth wallet encrypted balance.
- **Unshield** — Stealth wallet encrypted balance → Bank wallet public balance.
- **Private send** — Stealth user A's encrypted balance → Stealth user B's encrypted balance.
- **Move** — direction-aware flows between Bank ↔ Stealth ↔ Encrypted balance.
- **Claim** — receiver/sender claims pending UTXOs into their encrypted or public balance.

Internal code keeps `stealfWallet`, `STEALF_*` SecureStore keys, and `shielded` / `unshielded` verbs. The split is intentional and pinned in `docs/glossary.md`.

### Mainnet deployment

- `NETWORK = 'mainnet'` (`src/services/umbra/client.ts:21`)
- `RELAYER_API = 'https://relayer.api.umbraprivacy.com'` (`src/services/umbra/client.ts:22`)
- `INDEXER_API = 'https://utxo-indexer.api.umbraprivacy.com'` (`src/services/umbra/client.ts:23`)

The Solana RPC and WebSocket endpoints come from `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env vars (see `src/services/env.ts:7-8`).

## 3. Build, test, use

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15+ (iOS 16+ simulator or device)
- Node 20+
- CocoaPods (`sudo gem install cocoapods`)

### Clone + install

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd stealf-app
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` per the table in [`README.md`](README.md#environment-variables).

### Native build

```bash
npx expo run:ios                          # debug
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release  # realistic perf check
```

`expo start` works for UI-only iteration; ZK and Solana paths require the native build.

### Testing

`npm test` runs Vitest on **pure functions only**: Zod schemas, helpers, reducers. Anything that touches React Native (SecureStore, Turnkey native module, Umbra ZK provers) is exercised manually on a physical iOS device. There is no Jest / Detox harness in this repo.

Manual test checklist for an Umbra-integration smoke run:

1. OAuth signup (Google or Apple) → bank wallet auto-provisioned → stealth wallet created during onboarding.
2. First Shield: Bank wallet public USDC balance → Stealth wallet encrypted balance. Verify the encrypted-balance pill updates and the Bank balance decreases by the shielded amount + fee.
3. Check encrypted balance: open the Stealth tab and verify the encrypted balance matches the shielded amount.
4. First Private send: send a small USDC amount to a known Stealf user (set up two test devices). Verify the recipient sees a pending UTXO in `claims`.
5. Recipient claims the UTXO. Balance shows up in their encrypted balance.

### User journey

The intended product flow:

1. **OAuth signup.** User taps Google or Apple → Turnkey provisions a sub-organization and a Solana wallet. Stealf creates the local stealth wallet at the same time.
2. **Bank-wallet first use.** USDC is deposited into the bank wallet from any external Solana source, or from the Stealf card top-up once cash on-ramp is wired.
3. **Shield.** User chooses to move some balance into the encrypted balance for privacy.
4. **Private send / receive.** User-to-user encrypted USDC flows over Umbra UTXOs.
5. **Unshield + cash-out.** User unshields back to the public bank wallet → off-ramp to fiat via the Stealf card.

### Mainnet / devnet

The Umbra `network` constant is hardcoded to `'mainnet'` at `src/services/umbra/client.ts:21`. To run a local devnet test, change that constant to `'devnet'` and point `EXPO_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SOLANA_WSS_URL` at a devnet endpoint. The Umbra relayer and indexer endpoints are mainnet-only.
